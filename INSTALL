Installation Instructions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

0. Configure your PHP installation. The following options are required:

    allow_call_time_pass_reference = On
    short_open_tag = Off

    Please also setup your default timezone.
    http://php.net/date.timezone
    e.g. date.timezone = "Europe/Berlin"

1. Copy the contents of the "src/" directory to your webserver, including all
   subdirectories.

2. Change the permissions of "src/data/" (recursively) so that the webserver
   can write into the directory. This can either be done using your FTP client
   (consult the documentation of the client in case you use one), or by using
   the following command on the webserver:

     chmod -R a+rwX src/data/

3. Make sure that your database server has an existing database! The installer
   will ask you for a database, but it will not create one for you.

     - If you are running the forum in a hosted webspace, your webspace
       provider has to provide you with the tools to do this.
     - If you are running your own server it is presumed that you know how
       to do create a database.

4. Point your browser to the installer/ directory. For example:

     http://www.mydomain.com/freech/installer/

5. Follow the installation instructions.

6. Delete the installer/ directory. You are done!

7. If you want to, you may now customize your installation by adding
   options into the data/config.inc.php file.
   For a list of available options please check the file
   'default_config.inc.php' that comes with this package.
