Installation Instructions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. Copy the contents of the "src/" directory to your webserver, including all
   subdirectories.

2. Change the permissions of "src/data/" (recursively) so that the webserver
   can write into the directory. This can either be done using your FTP client
   (consult the documentation of the client in case you use one), or by using
   the following command on the webserver:

     chmod -R a+rwX src/data/

3. Point your browser to the installer/ directory. For example:

     http://www.mydomain.com/freech/installer/

4. Follow the installation instructions.

5. Delete the installer/ directory. You are done!

6. If you want to, you may now customize your installation by adding
   options into the data/config.inc.php file.
   For a list of available options please check the file
   'default_config.inc.php' that comes with this package.

software. Also, do not forget to file bugs on the homepage if you find any.
