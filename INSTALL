Installation Instructions

1. Copy the contents of the "src/" directory to your webserver, including all
   subdirectories.

2. Change the permissions of "src/smarty/templates_c/" so that the webserver
   can write into the directory. This can either be done somewhere in your
   FTP client (consult the documentation of the client in case you use one),
   or by using the command:
   chmod 777 src/smarty/templates_c/
   on the webserver.

3. Edit the file "config.inc.php" according to your needs. It should be self
   explaining.

4. Create your database tables using the file mysql_matpath.sql. If you have a
   rented webspace, you usually do this by loading the file in the phpMyAdmin
   tool provided by your webspace provider.

5. Done. You can now open the webpage.
