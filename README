FAQ
---

Q: I get an error message after installing the forum:
   "Smarty error: unable to write to $compile_dir"
A: You did not read the installation instructions in the INSTALL file :-).
   Particulary, you want to read the instructions under step 2.

Q: I changed the theme in the configfile but the old theme still appears.
A: The theme is cached on the server. Delete the contents of
   "src/smarty/templates_c/" and the new theme should appear.

Q: Is RSS supported? Where is the RSS file?
A: RSS2.0 is supported. The RSS file is in the same directory in which the
   index.php file is. You likely want to enter the following path into your
   newsreader:
   http://www.mydomain.com/freech/rss.php

Q: But the RSS file gives me the messages from all forums, I want to track only
   the messages from one single forum.
A: Try
   http://www.mydomain.com/freech/rss.php?forum_id=1
   (where "1" is of course replaced by the correct forum id.)

Q: The forum does not work, the trees are all broken when they get larger.
A: Your MySQL server does not support InnoDB tables. You need to delete all
   existing database tables, then configure MySQL to support InnoDB. After
   that, re-install Freech by following the instructions in the INSTALL file.

Q: I am logged out too often, Freech does not remember my session even when
   setting the flag in the login form.
A: For long session timeouts to work, your PHP installation has to support
   it. By default, PHP deletes a session after 1440 seconds.
   To increase this time you may add the following statement to your php.ini
   (on Unix/Linux systems usually in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini):

     session.gc_maxlifetime = 1000000
