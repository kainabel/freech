1. Copy the contents of the "src/" directory to your webserver, including all
   subdirectories.

2. Edit the file "config.inc.php" according to your needs. It should be self
   explaining.

3. Create your database tables using the file mysql_matpath.sql. If you have a
   rented webspace, you usually do this by loading the file in the phpMyAdmin
   tool provided by your webspace provider.

4. Done. You can now open the webpage.
