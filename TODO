Maintenance
------------
* Create a dedicated PluginAPI object and pass that to plugins instead
  of the Forum instance.
* Expose menu objects to the plugins to let them register new items.
* Find a clean way for adding plugin preferences.
* Possibly add a way to prevent plugins from loading that does not
  include modifying a plugin header. (Read: add an option to
  config.inc.php.)
* Design a URL scheme that makes sense for URL rewriting.
* Use gettext and .po/-mo-files to replace the home grown thingy.

Features
---------
* Add a search field to the breadcrumbs bar.
* Respect freech_posting.force_stub.
* Display the moderation log when viewing a locked message.
* Display the moderation log in the moderator's profile.
* Make the front page prettier.
